## Introduction
This is a streamlit app. Not a web app. It uses random forest classifer for making the predictions.

# Conda commands to create and activate virtual environment

## To run the streamlit app
- Run the flight_price.ipynb file
- streamlit run app.py

## Need to improve
- Find dataset with more cities
- More flight company data needed
- Need to implement hybrid model

# To run the project locally

# To Do after every update
- Move the newly installed libraries in the mlenv virtual environment to the requirements.txt file
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
